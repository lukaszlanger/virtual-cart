# Virtual Cart ðŸ“±ðŸ›’

Virtual Cart is a mobile application used to scan products during grocery shopping. Its idea is that before inserting the product into the shopping basket, we scan the barcode with the phone camera, and the application adds the product to our virtual shopping basket, where we see the estimated amount of the entire purchase. The application works on both Android and iOS.

## Technology stack
The application was programmed using **Ionic Framework** and **Angular**. Communication with the **Microsoft SQL** database is performed by the web-api application written in **.NET Core (Entity Framework Core).**

## Features

- Scanning of food products
- Management of items in the shopping cart
- Shopping list based on previously purchased products
- Possibility to add a product to the database if one does not exist when scanning the barcode

## Development

The database present in the project currently has only test products. As part of the extension of the application, cooperation with popular grocery stores or websites with a price comparison engine could be done. In addition, if the application went into production, it could be transferred to cloud solutions.
